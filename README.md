# AverageDailyJuggle
Average Daily Juggle - Flutter Mobile Application

Average daily juggle is an app for those who enjoy playing a little soccer (specifically juggling or keepie uppie or whatever you call it).
The user can easily keep track of how many touches they can get and see their average score displayed or the highest score by double tapping the number.
The app also uses local notifactions to remind users to get some touches in!
